the rbxlx jsons made should be our BASE data.

After that, we check if it has a wiki page.

example: American Flag -> https://ftbc.fandom.com/wiki/American_Flag

i'll go over each section of the wiki page that we need to parse.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
<div align="center" style="position:fixed; z-index:-1; top:0; left:0; right:0; bottom:0;"> [[File:{{{File|Main Realm Sky.webp}}}|{{{Size|2000px}}}]] </div>
<div style="--theme-accent-color:-webkit-linear-gradient(#23bd1c,#188a13); --theme-accent-label-color:#ffffff;">
<div style="position:relative; z-index:1;">

this is the background image section.
basically replace File|Main Realm Sky.webp with the realm icon image from realms.json:
Main Realm Sky.webp
then we replace #23bd1c,#188a13 with the two colors from the realm icon in realms.json:
"colors": [
        "#23bd1c",
        "#188a13"
    ]
then we keep the #ffffff as is.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

{{CharacterInfo|name=American Flag
|character=<gallery>
American Flag New.png|American Flag New
American Flag.png|American Flag Old
</gallery>
|difficulty= [[File:Effortless.png]] <span style="color:#17a897">'''Effortless'''</span>
|area=[[City]]
|hint=this donut shop is america-certified. LAND OF THE FREEE BABY!!!!!!!!
|additionalinfo
|previousdifficulties = 
[[File:Event.png]] <span style="color:#DF81C2">'''Event'''</span>
[[File:Easy.png]] <span style="color:#10da8d">'''Easy'''</span>
}}

this is the CharacterInfo template section.
we replace the name= value with the name of the item.
then we replace the |character= gallery images with the images from the rbxlx json.
then we replace the |difficulty= value with the current difficulty of the item from the rbxlx json.
then we replace the |area= value with the realm of the item from the rbxlx json.
then we replace the |hint= value with the description/hint of the item from the rbxlx json.
then we leave |additionalinfo as is.
then we replace the |previousdifficulties= value with the previous difficulties of the item from the rbxlx json.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[[Category:Objects]]
[[Category:Effortless Objects]]
[[Category:City Objects]]
[[Category:Main Realm Objects]]
these are the categories at the bottom of the wiki page.
we replace the categories based on the data from the rbxlx json.
stuff like City Objects can be implemented later, so...

Objects is for ALL items.
then we add a category for the current difficulty of the item, e.g. Effortless Objects.
then we add a category for the realm of the item, e.g. Main Realm Objects.

page example 2: Jade -> https://ftbc.fandom.com/wiki/Jade
<div align="center" style="position:fixed; z-index:-1; top:0; left:0; right:0; bottom:0;"> [[File:ClassicParadiseRealm.png|2000px]] </div>
<div style="--theme-accent-color:-webkit-linear-gradient(#3487d6, #479ad9); --theme-accent-label-color:#ffffff;">
<div style="position:relative; z-index:1;">
{{CharacterInfo|name=Jade
|character=[[File:Jade.webp]]
|difficulty= [[File:Remorseless.png]] <span style="color:#2084ff">'''Remorseless'''</span>
|area=[[Classic Paradise]]
|hint=Take a leap of faith in the cave.
}}

==Info==
Jade is a green, faceted gemstone with a nervous expression, featuring wide oval eyes and a tense, gritted smile carved into the front of her gem. She is one of Ruby's many sisters.

!'''How to Find Jade [SPOILERS]'''||
|-
|Head into the main cave of Classic Paradise. There’s a hidden drop that’s safe to fall into — take the leap of faith.<br>
Once inside the chamber, you’ll encounter three puzzle panels:
== Puzzle 1: “maybe look at it from another angle?” ==
'''Hint 1:''' Try physically rotating or flipping the letters you’re given. Some upside-down letter shapes resemble numbers.<br>
'''Hint 2:''' Each 4-letter chunk becomes a sequence of digits. Don’t add them! Just place them in order.<br>
'''Hint 3:''' After assembling the digit groups, consider converting numbers to letters (A1Z26 may help).
== Puzzle 2: “lol no it’s not!” ==
'''Hint 1:''' The layout resembles something very common with 3×3 grids.<br>
'''Hint 2:''' Don’t focus on the squares themselves, check what each square represents.<br>
'''Hint 3:''' Sort the items alphabetically, then apply a cipher associated with 3×3 grids.
== Puzzle 3: “watch out, it’s a devious one…” ==
'''Hint 1:''' One of the strings resembles a YouTube ID, but the other string is the actual puzzle.<br>
'''Hint 2:''' The video subtly suggests which cipher to apply... think classical substitutions.<br>
'''Hint 3:''' You will likely need to apply two ciphers in sequence.
== Results ==
After solving all three puzzles, you’ll receive a code in the format: '''/e 1-2-3''' (not the actual code). All of the codes are Gemstones.<br>
Enter it in the text box, and Jade will appear near one of the corners of the room.

[[Category:Objects]]
[[Category:Remorseless Objects]]
[[Category:Classic Paradise Objects]]
</div>
</div>
this is another example of a wiki page.
notice a few differences (besides obtainment and info)?
1. the |character= section has only one image instead of a gallery.
that is because the "New" image doesn't exist. So we just take [[File:Jade.webp]] from the html.
2. there is no |previousdifficulties= section because there are no previous difficulties for this item.
so we just leave that part out entirely.
3. there is an ==Info== and ==Obtaining== section.
we don't need to parse these sections, we can just leave them as is.
4. the categories at the bottom are different based on the realm and difficulty of the item.

json format example:
"Cheese Orb": {
    "name": "Cheese Orb",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "description": "cheese orb is in the game. peace has been restored",
    "realm": "Barren Desert",
    "realmData": {
      "label": "Barren Desert",
      "icon": "BarrenDesertRealm.png",
      "link": "Barren_Desert",
      "image": "Barren Desert Sky.webp",
      "colors": [],
      "gradient": "-webkit-linear-gradient(#c4a747, #8b7355)",
      "accent": "#ffffff"
    },
    "images": [],
    "difficultyInfo": {
      "icon": "Easy.png",
      "color": "#10da8d"
    },
    "previousDifficulties": [],
    "categories": [
      "Objects",
      "Easy Objects",
      "Barren Desert Objects"
    ],
    "wiki": {
      "info": "",
      "obtaining": ""
    }
  }
this is found in /metadata/objectjsons/Barren Desert.json
-----------------------------------------------------------------
How to grab images:
this should be first priority (helps with getting the correct characterinfo format!):
try all image variants:
- .jpg, .png, .webp
https://ftbc.fandom.com/wiki/File:Jade.webp
https://ftbc.fandom.com/wiki/File:Jade.png
https://ftbc.fandom.com/wiki/File:Jade.jpg
- with "New" suffix (e.g. American Flag New.png)
https://ftbc.fandom.com/wiki/File:Jade New.webp
https://ftbc.fandom.com/wiki/File:Jade New.png
https://ftbc.fandom.com/wiki/File:Jade New.jpg
if you get "New" and the original, use both in a gallery.
if you only get one image, just use that one.
if you get no images, leave it blank.
