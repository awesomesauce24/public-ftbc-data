== Character ==
Jade is a green, faceted gemstone with a nervous expression, featuring wide oval eyes and a tense, gritted smile carved into the front of her gem. She is one of Ruby's many sisters.

== Obtaining ==
Head into the main cave of Classic Paradise. There’s a hidden drop that’s safe to fall into — take the leap of faith.<br>
Once inside the chamber, you’ll encounter three puzzle panels:

== Puzzle 1: “maybe look at it from another angle?” ==
'''Hint 1:''' Try physically rotating or flipping the letters you’re given. Some upside-down letter shapes resemble numbers.<br>
'''Hint 2:''' Each 4-letter chunk becomes a sequence of digits. Don’t add them! Just place them in order.<br>
'''Hint 3:''' After assembling the digit groups, consider converting numbers to letters (A1Z26 may help).

== Puzzle 2: “lol no it’s not!” ==
'''Hint 1:''' The layout resembles something very common with 3×3 grids.<br>
'''Hint 2:''' Don’t focus on the squares themselves, check what each square represents.<br>
'''Hint 3:''' Sort the items alphabetically, then apply a cipher associated with 3×3 grids.

== Puzzle 3: “watch out, it’s a devious one…” ==
'''Hint 1:''' One of the strings resembles a YouTube ID, but the other string is the actual puzzle.<br>
'''Hint 2:''' The video subtly suggests which cipher to apply... think classical substitutions.<br>
'''Hint 3:''' You will likely need to apply two ciphers in sequence.

== Results ==
After solving all three puzzles, you’ll receive a code in the format: '''/e 1-2-3''' (not the actual code).<br>
Enter it in the text box, and Jade will appear near one of the corners of the room.
