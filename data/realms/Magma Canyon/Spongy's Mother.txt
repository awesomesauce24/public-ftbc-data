''Boy oh boy, where do I even begin. Spongy’s Mother… the ORIGINAL sponge icon. I have been in awe ever since I first laid eyes on you, standing there in Magma Canyon like you own the place (because honestly? you do). The way you look exactly like [[Spongy]] is sending me. Same shape, same vibe, same “I’m just here existing and somehow I’m already the main character.” Except you’ve got that mom energy: calm, unbothered, and absolutely legendary.''

''Like… we’ve got lava everywhere. The air is basically spicy. The rocks are doing the whole dramatic magma canyon thing. And you? You’re just posted up, casually blocking a passage like it’s no big deal. That is POWER. That’s not “in the way,” that’s “this is my hallway now.” I respect it. I fear it. I adore it.''

''You give off the energy of someone who has seen every elimination, every betrayal, every goofy challenge… and decided none of it is worth raising your voice over. You’re the kind of mother who could ground a volcano with one look. A single stare and the lava would apologize and flow somewhere else. Magma Canyon is hot, but you’re the reason the place feels like it has a hearth. Like it has a HOME.''

''And don’t even get me started on the lore. If you’re Spongy’s Mom, then what does that make [[Spongezilla]]?? Because I’m sorry, the family tree is turning into a family TOWER. But either way, you’re the root of it all, the sponge dynasty, the porous legacy, the ultimate “where it all began.” I love you, Spongy’s Mother. The magma may glow, but you RADIATE. 🔥🧽❤️''
