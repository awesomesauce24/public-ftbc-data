!'''How to Find [SPOILERS]'''||
|-
|To obtain Singapore Map, find 8 buttons:

'''1:''' After passing the 2nd orange bridge, go to the first floor of the left side of the building you are standing on. The button is in the corner.<br> 

'''2:''' Directly beneath the '''Realm Egg''' for [[peep]].<br>   

'''3:''' Near button 1. Walk down the metallic grey stairs on the side of the building. The button is on the bottom step near the void (angle your jump).<br> 

'''4:''' Next to [[Burger Blanket]]: on the right corner of the same building, on the wall (assuming you are looking from Spawn)<br>   

'''5:''' On the crane railings, near the entrance to [[Bandy]].<br>   

'''6:''' On the crates behind spawn, on top of the building.<br>   

'''7:''' After the 1st orange bridge, turn right. On the “Hotel” building — on the bottom third floor, left window, bottom-left corner.<br>   

'''8:''' Walk the long path to the end where the burning barrel and door are (near [[Spray Can]] and [[Thready]]). The button is on the door.<br> 

After crossing the new path at spawn (behind spawn, near the crates of button 6), you will reach the building where Singapore Map is located.<br>   
He is found on the upper-right side of the building, on the bottom floor.
