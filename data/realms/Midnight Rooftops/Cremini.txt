== Info ==
'''''Hate'''. Let me tell you how much I've come to '''hate''' you since I began to play this game. There are 1078 objects scattered throughout the game, yet I managed to obtain [[Firey.FLA]] with less issues. If the word '''hate''' was engraved on each realm of those hundreds of millions of parts, it would not equal '''ONE ONE-BILLIONTH''' of the '''hate''' I feel for [[Cremini]] at this micro-instant. '''HATE'''. <big>'''HATE'''.</big>''

== Obtaining ==
'''''The following text will show instructions on how to get this object. If you wish to find it by yourself, avoid opening the text.'''''
