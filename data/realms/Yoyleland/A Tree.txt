==Character==
A Tree is just a regular tree. Just kidding, it's Gelatin on top of Match's head.
==Obtaining==
{{Spoiler|text=In the Yoyleland Realm, get to the top of Yoyle Mountain and the summit until you get to A Tree.}}
==Trivia==
*A Tree is technically not its own separate entity, as it's [[Match]] and [[Gelatin]] combined into one.
