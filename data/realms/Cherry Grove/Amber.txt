!'''How to Find [SPOILERS]'''||
|-
|Firstly, lets look at the hint: "Remember this:XYYXZWYXZXZWZ". This string of letters features the last four letters of the alphabet, keep this in mind. Now, If you have explored [[Cherry Grove]] a bit, near [[Jelly Bread]] you should find a green button with seemingly no purpose. That is until you notice four crates in a row that each can be clicked. What do you do with these crates you may ask? well the crates and the green button on the tree are all part of a keypad that has 4 main inputs. What else has 4 of something? The string of letters in the hint! Using the first letter (W) to represent the first crate on the left, X to represent the second crate and so on, you can input the letters into the crates then press the green button. Once you do, the amber casing near [[Chainsaw]] will open, allowing you to collect Amber.
