[[File:Metallic peak - under.png|thumb|The start of the Metallic Peak obby.]]
it's a near impossible obby that you can get by joining [[nice try]] and getting the 1 badge (i recommend watching a youtube video) and then go to the stone structure and pick up the watch thing and then find the speed coil and shift the time until a blue beam pops up and then climb the blue beam while holding the speed coil and you will be teleported to [[Unfamiliar Territory|unfamiliar territory]] and then go in between the benevolence and perseverance portals and walk up the invisible path and then the doors will check if you have the other 5 badges and for some reason additionally the torch puzzle and then you will see the obby
