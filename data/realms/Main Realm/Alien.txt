==Character==
Alien looks like what you'd see on one of those Top 10 Alien Sightings clickbait videos.
==Obtaining==
Find 8 buttons in:

# {{Spoiler|text=The tree where [[Marimo Ball]] is.}}
# {{Spoiler|text=The rightside of the house with a fence in [[Snowy]].}}
# {{Spoiler|text=The pot in Roblox HQ near [[Loser]].}}
# {{Spoiler|text=The roof of the tallest house in [[Desert]].}}
# {{Spoiler|text=The lollipop near Factory, Warehouse, and Fossil Falls in [[Candyland]].}}
# {{Spoiler|text=[https://imgur.com/a/YjmZEX6 The bench foot of a bench] in [[Number Playground]].}}
# {{Spoiler|text=The conveyor at [[Factory]] (inside).}}
# {{Spoiler|text=The elevator button at the yellow floor of [[Hotel]]}}

Then go back to [[Goiky]], a platform leading to Alien should appear.
