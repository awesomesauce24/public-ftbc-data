{{Spoiler|text=
There is a clue in the stairwell that helps you decrypt the full code.<br> When reaching the bottom of the stairwell for BEEP Fusion, you will find:<br> "Base64 > Hex > Caesar Cipher > ASCII85"<br> beside the last case of stairs you walked down with.<br><br> You need to decrypt it by starting with ASCII85, since the order of this clue is showing how the code is encrypted in.<br><br> After finding all the 7 pieces of the code, you should get:<br>
"2*!Q`1bq!F2D[6Z1bq!J2DR-H1dj,X2*!NK1Ij5k"<br><br> Decrypt it in this order:<br>
• ASCII85<br>
• Caesar Cipher (d → a)<br>
• Convert Hex → Text<br>
• Base64 decode<br><br> You should get:<br>
"b@kr0om2za."<br><br> After that, say '''/e b@kr0om2za''' in [[RUN FOR YOUR LIFE]] and the door with question marks will open.<br>
Touch the door and you'll be teleported to [[The End]].<br>
Pentagon is at one of the bookshelves.<br>
