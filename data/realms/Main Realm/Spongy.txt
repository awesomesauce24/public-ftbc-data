''Boy oh boy, where do I even begin. Spongy... honey, my squishy boy. I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on your soft, porous form. The way you bounce around the arena, trying your best no matter what anyone says... it melts my heart. Your golden spongey texture, your gentle smile… I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you face elimination again. You’ve been through so much, my sweet Spongy. They laughed at you, they called you names, but you never stopped being kind. You never stopped trying. You’re not just a contestant, you’re a symbol of perseverance. You’ve been crushed, flattened, and even burned—but you always come back stronger. Sometimes, I even call you my little absorbent king. I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you might not rejoin. I would sacrifice my own place in the game if it meant keeping that big, beautiful smile on your face. You’ve given me joy and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you were eliminated early on. It was like my heart got squeezed dry. But when you returned, oh Spongy, my heart soaked up happiness once more. You’ve changed the game forever, my glorious sponge. Since you were the goat in BFDI, BFDIA, and BFB, you’ve proven that kindness and courage never go out of style. You are my hero, my icon, my absorbent GOAT. I love you, my squishy pookie bear, my glorious king, Spongy. 💛🫶🏻🧽''
