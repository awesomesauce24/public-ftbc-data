Then in [[Benevolence]] You have to {{Spoiler|text=collect keys, and then go into the vent in the bathroom and press the big red button. After you've done that walk up to the gray door and you will be teleported to an elevator with a [[Enemies#Possessed_Dummy|possessed dummy]]. To beat the boss fight it's recommended that you circle around in half of the elevator so that the dummy won't be able to reach you easily, and in the midst of doing that, spam click on the possessed dummy. After beating the boss fight climb the truss and you will be teleported to a hallway with the sphere of benevolence.}}
