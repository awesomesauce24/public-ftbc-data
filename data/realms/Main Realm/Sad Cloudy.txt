Get to the Fourest by going to where [[Profiley]] is at and going through a non-collidable wall where [[Four]] is at. When you're at the Fourest, go to the EXIT and dance clip on the wall (specifically the one with the large window) until you're outside the map. Afterwards, wall flick upwards until you reach the top of [[Oodle]]'s area and keep going until you find a missing wall. Go down towards [[Oodle]] until you're suddenly teleported to a death trap where you slowly descend downwards where '''Sad Cloudy''' is at.</div>
