Not to be confused with [[Cali]]
== Character ==
idk what i can say... hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... He used to have the same asset as [[Cali]] (Like [[Dollar Bill]] and [[Zero Dollar Bill]])

== Obtaining ==
Go to [[City]], then look under the trees near the cars, you'll find a text that says "Square Root of 49?", find the square root of 49, which is 7.

So just say "'''/e 7'''" in chat and you will get it.

== Trivia ==

* The text used to say "Square Root of 7?", but due to some calculators either giving too few decimals or too much decimals, it is changed to "Square Root of 49?".
