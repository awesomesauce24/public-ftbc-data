==Trivia==
*Firey is the only character to have their sprite change during a specific time, with him having a Halloween costume during October.
*Firey is one of the only 3 objects to have their sprite float, which is when he is using his aforementioned Halloween design. And the other 2 objects being [[Hypostasis]] and [[Asteroid]].
*It has been hinted that Firey may have special dialogue if you collect him as your last object.
**This could just be a hoax by the developers.
