{{CharacterInfo|name=Boltzmann's Brain|character=[[File:Boltzmann's Brain.png]]|difficulty=Horrifying|area=[[Storm Of Doom|City?]]|hint=begin by looking within the eye of the storm}}
==Character==
Boltzmann's Brain resembles a poorly drawn Puffball with black looking color and white eyes.
==Obtaining==
First, go to [[Storm Of Doom]], then if you look the obby from the bottom, you'll see a black path somewhere near the end of the obby. Walk to the end of that path and you'll get teleported to [[????????????]]. In there, you might find [[King Cake]], but there are also codes scattered around the place, 16 of them. Once you find all of it, it'll say {{Spoiler|text="dW5rbjB3bjlyNQ==", if you decode that (base64), you'll get "unkn0wn9r5". Finally, go back to the main realm then say "'''/e unkn0wn9r5'''". Touch the black teleporter and you'll be teleported to [[mooD fo mrotS]]}}.

Good luck with the bossfight!

# The bossfight used to only have 1 phase
# Phase 1 of the bossfight used to only have 10,000 HP (now it's 12,000 HP)
