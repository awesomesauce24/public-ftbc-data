Start by going into one of the haybales at [[Goiky]], you'll get teleported to a room with a math question and a silhouette of [[Starwalker]]. If you look at the math question, you'll see that there are unknown variables like B, L, and T, so we need to find them. If you look at the railings of the Roblox HQ (in [[City]]), you'll see that one of them has "lollipops at candyland, L". If you count the lollipops at candyland, you'll get 5, so L = 5. Then go to [[Number Playground]], in under one of the trees, it says "trees at spawn, T", count the trees at spawn and you'll get 63 (the tree under spawn also counts), T = 63. Finally, if you go to the yellow floor in [[Hotel]], you'll see "buildings in the city (excluding Donut Shop), B", so B = 6. Go back to the question and solve it. If you did everything correctly, you should get 15.8745078664, remove the decimal and you'll get "'''/e 158745078664'''".</div>
