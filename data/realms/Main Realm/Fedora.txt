==Obtaining==
If you look behind the update log sign at [[Goiky]], you'll see "wjhat?? why is sign here ???? Maybe if you DiD someThing Cool You coUld get Something". If you took the capital letters only, you'll get "MDDTCYUS". {{Spoiler|text=When you shift y -> a caesar cipher, you'll get [https://www.roblox.com/users/4205496971 OFFVEAWU], which is a Roblox Account. Looking at its about section, you'll see "63 31 70 68 65 72 67 61 6D 69 6E 67". Decoding it from Hex gives us "c1phergaming". Then, say "'''/e c1phergaming'''" in the Main Realm. After that, dance clip to the wooden wall.}}

{{Spoiler|text=When you enter the room, it seems that there's nothing in it. But if you look at the corner of the room, you'll see "THE DESCRIPTION". Looking at the description of [https://www.roblox.com/games/9065183016 FTBC], you'll see "L2UgckBuZDBtdDN4dA==", decoding it gives "'''/e r@nd0mt3xt'''". '''Fedora''' is under the room.}}
