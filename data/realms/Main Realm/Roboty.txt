'''Roboty''' appears to be a red robot with green robotic eyes and a white mouth, along with an antenna.
==Obtaining==
{{Spoiler|text=Teleport to the [[Medal Room]] by clicking "Reset" on the top-right corner of the Objectpedia, then you'll find Roboty.}}

== Trivia ==

* Roboty used to be Hard difficulty
* For a short period of time, Roboty used to be impossible due to the medal room's teleporter not working correctly. This was quickly changed after [[Klaptai]] began to work on the game more frequently.
