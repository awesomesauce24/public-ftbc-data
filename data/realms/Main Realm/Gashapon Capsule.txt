Gashapon Capsule is a small, glossy capsule toy with a rounded glass-like top and a bright purple base. They have simple black eyes and a soft smile, giving them a calm, cheerful look despite being a mystery capsule. Their body shape resembles the classic Japanese gashapon toys you’d find in vending machines.
