{{Spoiler|text=Start in [[Yoyleland]], at the edge of the ramp?, on the right side, you should see "GAME RELEASE DATE", which is "3/11/2022" -> "31122". Go to [[A BFDI|BFDI]]'s place, then get on top of the building (frog jump or from the right side). Then touch the Teleporter to [[Abandonment]]. Type in "31122" on the computer's keyboard (by clicking the buttons) then click the Enter Key. A door should open up behind the monitor.}}
