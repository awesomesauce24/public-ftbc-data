==Character==
'''ARG Television''' was a Impossible object during it's 1st variant, then a Horrifying object, and now a Remorseless. It is also the first Impossible & Horrifying object to be added in Find The BFB Characters.

It is a Television with a Lemon metallic screen and a green face.

==Obtaining==
Start in [[Firey Speaker Box]]'s Area, then {{Spoiler|text=behind Firey Speakerbox, there's a text that says "OTI3NDk0MjM4NQ==", it's encoded in base64 so decoding it gives us 9274942385, which is a place id ( https://www.roblox.com/games/9274942385 ), join that game and you'll see that it looks like a normal starter place, but if you go to the structure surrounded by stone, there's a binary code behind the chest in the middle that reads "00101111 01100101 00100000 01100111 00110000 01101111 01100100 01101010 00110000 001100010 01111001 01101111 00110111", decoding it gives us "'''/e g0odj0byo7'''", which is the final code.}}
