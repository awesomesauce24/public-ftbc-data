== Obtaining ==
To unlock Fourteen, first find Fourteen by his cage in the [[Number Playground]].

Talk to them twice to trigger the sequence; after the second dialogue, they will teleport away and become touch-activated.

Find the NPC again and touch them four times:
* Touch #1 - They teleport to a new position  
* Touch #2 - They move again  
* Touch #3 - They move a third time  
* Touch #4 - You can obtain Fourteen
he does not teleport outside of [[Number Playground]], and he will tween to where he moves. It should be easy to catch.

== Character ==
Fourteen is a male green number character shaped like a "14", with a neutral smile and wide eyes.
