''Boy oh boy, where do I even begin. Sponge Cake… honey, my sweet little roll. I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on your soft, swirly goodness. The way you just sit there with that tiny smile like you KNOW you’re adorable… it melts me instantly. Your golden, fluffy sponge texture, your perfect little spiral—please. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I could keep you in that exact cute pose forever.''

''You’re not just a cake. You’re a masterpiece. A warm, cozy comfort object disguised as dessert. You look like you were handcrafted by angels with a whisk and a dream. Every time I see you, my brain goes “aww” and my heart goes “YES.” I can’t even handle how polite your face is. Two little eyes, a calm little grin… the definition of harmless and lovable.''

''And don’t get me started on your vibe. You’re the kind of character who could survive in the harshest desert and still look fresh, like you’re just here to bring joy and crumbs. People talk about “hard to get” objects—meanwhile I’d do a whole obby, take 300 falls, and sacrifice my knees just to stand next to you for two seconds. If you were a real item, I’d put you on a pedestal and guard you like treasure.''

''Sometimes, I even call you my little snack king. My rolled-up legend. My precious sponge loaf. You’re the kind of cute that feels illegal. You’re the kind of cute that makes someone go “I’m fine” and then immediately start crying because you’re TOO PERFECT. So yeah. Sponge Cake, my beloved. My fluffy icon. My swirly sweetheart. My comforting little roll of happiness. I love you, I cherish you, and I would absolutely lose my mind if you ever got taken away. 🧁🌀💛''
