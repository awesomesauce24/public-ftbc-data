== Appearance ==
self explanatory

== Obtaining ==
First we need to find an encrypted message in [[Barren Desert]], which is in {{Spoiler|text=the third trial of [[You Tried Star]] that says: OxTfnqNdCcye/TwkDNCIZ+STmzmetGcZ spicy (20)tea (might've been changed)}}, solving it gives you {{Spoiler|text="h0t+ch3et3o^3s6!"}}. enter it in the /e UI and you can get Hot Cheese Puff.
