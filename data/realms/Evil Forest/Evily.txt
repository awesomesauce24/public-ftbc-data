'''NEW METHOD:'''  Do the obby and find vault, get your camera inside the vault and click exit button and door will open, idk what is the code for the vault


'''OLD METHOD:''' The code for the vault in [[Evil Forest]] is "'''3600123'''", though it is still unknown how to legitimately get the code since people can just click the open button inside the vault from the outside.
