Every Character Fused | terrifying | occasionally, I find myself in a contemplative state, ruminating upon the underlying purpose and significance of undertaking the development of this particular game. it raises a fundamental question: what is the rationale for investing time and energy into the creation of this gaming endeavor? after all, it appears improbable that this game will retain any substantial relevance in the forthcoming years. furthermore, one must not disregard the inescapable reality that every game, no matter how compelling or captivating, eventually reaches its culmination, and thus, there looms an impending terminus for this game. in light of these contemplations, I am led to ponder, what exactly is the intrinsic value in expending my efforts on this venture? the temptation to embark on a protracted discourse regarding the futility of laboring on this game is palpable, yet I am inclined to demur, for such a discourse, it appears, would be an exercise in futility itself. It is my supposition that this project occupies a unique place in my heart, an endeavor in which I aspire to manifest my creative fervor and enthusiasm, driven by an innate desire to make a positive impact and bring forth something meaningful. it is true that the developers known as "Spooky" and "Funky" do not exhibit a frequent propensity for updating this game, which leads me to ponder the extent of my own contributions. without undue hubris, I dare say that the current state of the game, teetering on the brink of reaching a landmark of a thousand objects, can, to a certain extent, be attributed to my dedication and involvement. it should be noted, though, that the precise number of objects may indeed have already achieved the coveted one thousand, or it may remain tantalizingly close, contingent upon the point in time at which you peruse this composition.
