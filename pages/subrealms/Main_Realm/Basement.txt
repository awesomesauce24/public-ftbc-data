p.s, you spawn in looking to the right.

== Trivia ==
* This whole sub-realm is taken from Find the Idoits and was originally named '''''Nyctophobia'''''
* This sub-realm is the biggest sub-realm in the game, with 17 collectables!  
** Maaaybe because it used to be a main realm instead of a sub-realm in *Find the Idoits, but whatever.
* Kinda unrelated, but I always forget that [[Blackbelt]] is in this sub-realm instead of [[Level 153]].

* the only reason I actually finished the page was because [https://www.roblox.com/users/2289157465/profile Coolsandwich38] wanted to finish Yoylefactory. You're welcome, [https://www.roblox.com/users/2289157465/profile Coolsandwich38].
