{{distinguish|The Crystallized Core}}
== (realm) ==
this '''sub-realm''' is where you can find [[The Crystallized Core|the crystallized core]] so get all the badges in [[nice try]] and type "/e" followed by the code found in the "event" game and then go through the wooden walls and go through the maze in the cave until you find a hallway getting slowly narrower there will be [[The Crystallized Core|the crystallized core]] at the end

also one of the admins told me that to get the 2 badge you either need to do an unspecified puzzle in the main [[nice try]] realm or complete the [[metallic Peak]] obby in its respective realm but they also told me that the first method is not working right now so we are forced to go through 2763 or more hours of suffering to get it
