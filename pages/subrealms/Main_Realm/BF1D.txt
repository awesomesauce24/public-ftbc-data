== Trivia ==

* The fake skybox does not have collision, allowing you to fly though it via frog jumping.
** This was what led players to find [[THE Bot]] early.
* The reason [[BF1D Carrot]] and [[BF1D Ball]] have [[BF1D]] Before their names is likely because objects named [[Carrot]] and [[Ball]] Respectively already exist.
* When [[BF1D]] Released, [[Puddle]] was impossible to get the intended way as the water still had collision on, people still managed to get it with this bug by frog jumping up high then tab glitching into the solid water.
* This subrealm has the second most [[Objects]], only being beat by [[Basement]].
* This is the only subrealm in the game to give you a badge for getting every object.
