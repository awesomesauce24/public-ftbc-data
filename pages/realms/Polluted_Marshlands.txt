== Info ==
Polluted Marshlands is currently the last main realm to be added to the game. 

It is a wet marshland with pipes and industrial buildings that pollute the realm. You spawn on one of the lower islands, but there are 9 islands in total, as well as smaller ones. The only form of transportation in this realm is by parkouring on pipes and platforms, bridges, and the several moving platforms. On the top left island, you can also find a star-shaped object. Every three minutes, a turret will shoot out of the star, giving you access to multiple objects and another island. On the bottom right island, you can find a sewer entrance that can only be unlocked with a key. Inside the sewer tunnel is [[Mojito Glass]]. Other than those two, there are no notable landmarks in Polluted Marshlands.

[[File:Pm map.png|thumb|198x198px|Map of Polluted Marshlands without fog]]This realm has one unique gimmick, being its mud. Once you're in any piece of mud, you are unable to jump until you get out of it. There are no obbies or objects that require using mud, but you should be cautious when to jump when you're around any. The polluted water on the surface will take you back to spawn upon touching.[[File:Pm cave.png|thumb|197x197px|The cave]]If you click on a piece of wood under one of the platforms, you can find an entrance to ''Blob of Syrup's cave''. There are 3 objects in this cave you can find, including a pile of books that leads to Theebs' room.

== How to enter ==
Start in [[Jungle]], then look for an acid puddle near [[Slide Man]]
