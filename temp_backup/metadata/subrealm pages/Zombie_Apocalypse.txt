== How To Enter ==
Go to the sewers to where [[Immortality Thing]] is and then look towards the wall of the sewers.<br>
And on your right jump down and eventually you would land on an invisible path.<br>
At the end of the invisible path you should see a green tile and touch it.<br>
You will have to jump off the path for it.<br>

== Info ==
''Zombie Apocalypse'' is a map similar to the [[Hotel]] Area in the main realm, there are a few differences to this variation like the sky being green and structures like [[Gelatin]]'s Steakhouse being present. Additionally, there is a main enemy in this realm being the Zombies, they work like the Classic Roblox Zombies. You also get things to defend yourself with in this realm, like a sword for close combat, a bow for long range combat, and an apple for healing. The zombies do respawn if you kill them though.

== Trivia ==
*Zombie Apocalpyse is on the same planet as [[Polluted Marshlands]] and [[Yoyle Factory]]
**[[Yoyle Factory]] caused the air here to get Polluted which presumably made most objects that breathed it turn into a zombie.
