  "name": "Barf Bag",
  "difficulty": "moderate",
  "description": "Contemplating life: multifaceted in many ways yet following a pattern. Amidst a wave of ingenuity, compassion, creativity, and an ever increasing population of souls destined to part from this mortal plane or live on forever as memories. Life can best be defined as a dance of ideals and limitations. Nobody is perfect; neither you or me or ANYONE in this whole planet can call themselves flawless. While we may fight for our beliefs, it is important to remember that we all share the same basic components and should respect the beliefs of others instead of fighting because of them. Why barf bag of all objects to contain such a description like this? I don't know, I just felt like it. Expect more of these in the future I guess. Since you read all of this, Barf Bag is located on one of the museum's pillars. You'll need to get on top of the Library to reach. (Hidden in City)"
