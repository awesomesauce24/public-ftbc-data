  "description": "Have you accidentally killed a plant and want to revive it? Then why don't you set it on fire? And then freeze it? Let it grow on the sun? Or zap it? Make it a fancy dinner? Or feed it to a fish monster? Or push it off a cliff? Dance on it? Explode it? Vomit on it? Play with it underwater?"
